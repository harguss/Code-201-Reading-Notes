## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1-Greater efficiency
2-Engaged collaboration
3-Learning from a fellow student/co-worker
4-Improves social skills
5-Job interveiw readiness
6-Work enviorment readiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? Learning from a fellow student has been very beneficial for me. I really like watching other people code that I have a difficulty starting or completeing.

How does pair programming work?  Usually there is a driver and a navigator. The drivers roll is to execute the typing and their hands will be the only ones touching the keyboard. They manage switching files, text editing, and version control, and writing code.
The navigators roll is to think about the big picture, what comes next how an algorithim might be converted into code.  They also look for typos or bugs.
