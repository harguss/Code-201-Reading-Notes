This is where I post my notesWhat is functional programming?Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?It returns the same results if given the same arguments-deterministic,  It does not cause any observable side effects.

What are the benefits of a pure function? It is easier to test.

What is immutability?Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

What is Referential transparency?  If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
